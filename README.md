# Advent of Code
My work on the Advent of Code puzzles.  
See [here](http://adventofcode.com "advent of code") for more information.

I usually resolve these in Python 3, but I sometimes want to illustrate the problem visually, so I use [Processing](https://processing.org/) !

For example, next one is from [Day 20 - 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/20) :
![Visualization of day 20 - 2017 resolution with Processing](processing/2017/day20/gif/day20.gif)
